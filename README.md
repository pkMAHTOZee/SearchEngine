# SearchEngine

A search engine is a tool that allows users to search for information, images, videos, and more on the internet.
Google.com is a well-known example of a search engine.
The project is about implementing a simple search engine and understanding how it works behind the scenes.
The project allows users to search for top 30 results according to their query and displays their search history.
The two main functions of the project are to perform a search and to get user search history.
The project only includes two functions for simplicity.

The project will consist of three components: front end, back end, and a database.

HTML will be used for the front end, which is responsible for creating the structure of the web page.
CSS will be used for styling the web page, including elements such as background color, font color, and alignment.
JSP (Java Server Pages) will be used to connect the front end to the back end by allowing Java code to be written inside HTML files.
Java Servlets will be used for the back end, specifically for creating multiple mini servers to handle different types of calculations or operations.
MySQL, a popular database management system, will be used for storing and interacting with data.
